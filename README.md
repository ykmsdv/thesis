# Thesis Project

This repository includes all assignments for the thesis project part of the MSDV Major Studio 2 course.


###### Research question
I am studying the relationship between food and alcohol consumption and COVID-19 outcomes because I want to find out whether certain habits could be related to the severity of cases in order to help people make decisions which could help them prevent worse outcomes of the disease.

###### Questions I want to explore
- What are the factors affecting the development of the COVID-19 pandemic? 
- What factors affect outcomes?
- Is food and alcohol consumption related to better or worse outcomes? 

###### Outline, first draft:
1. Introduction:
	* Provide context to readers - pandemic and nutrition metadata
	* Why am I researching the relationship between nutrition and COVID? 
	* What data I am using for the project; any treatments that should be mentioned
2. Treatment
	* Thorough presentation of the hypothesis - are COVID outcomes related to nutrition?
	* Has this been investigated? Projects which do or do not analyze such relationship
	* Analysis based on the thesis project - supporting or refuting the research hypothesis
	* Sources: citations from articles, analysis and comparison of the statements and conclusions of the cited sources
3. Conclusion
	* Summary of the outcomes of the analysis, research and visualization. 	Are we one step closer to accepting or rejecting the research hypothesis?
